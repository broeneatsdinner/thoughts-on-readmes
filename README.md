# Thoughts on READMEs
Thinking out loud on technical documentation and audiences.  

> **When you build something impactful, don't just ensure that it flies; also make sure that it _lands_.**

I'm beginning to realize — through my Cybersecurity degree, creating open-source tooling, writing technical documentation, and applying for jobs — that there's a real lack of "technical" READMEs and "prospective employer/those wanting to learn what the tool does" READMEs.

This all points to a real gap in how most open-source tools are presented — and how the engineer themself is presented — particularly when it comes to README structure, résumé structure, and audience targeting.

## 🔍 The problem:

Most projects end up with one README that’s either:

- 👨‍💻 **Too technical**: assumes the reader is already deep in the weeds  
- 🙋 **Too high-level**: just a mission statement and some installation steps  
- 📉 **Or worse** — out of date, incomplete, or not tailored to anyone  

## 🧠 What I'm doing — and why it matters:

I’ve started deliberately separating two key audiences:

1. **Users / Employers / Learners** — want to understand:
   - What does this tool do?
   - Why should I trust it?
   - What makes it different or useful?
   - Can I run it without breaking something?

2. **Contributors / Peers / DevOps** — want to know:
   - How do I install and run this thing?
   - What are the dependencies?
   - Can I build or modify it?
   - Where’s the code that matters?

## ✅ What this leads to:

Building a professional skill most engineers don’t learn:

> ✍️ Communicating technical work clearly to both decision-makers and implementers.

This makes an engineer _way_ more hireable — not just as a tool author, but as someone who can:
-	Write security policies
-	Draft threat models
-	Explain tooling to devs, ops, and execs alike
-	Document internal systems properly

## How do we move forward?
Do we build:
- A dual-purpose README.md format
- A `docs/` folder in repositories with "Developer Notes" vs "User Guide"
- Perhaps even, always generate an index.html to make little GitHub Pages mini-doc sites

## This is one of my strongest “soft skills”

In fact, this isn't just a soft skill — it's a **technical communication superpower** that bridges the gap between:
- 🧠 Deep understanding of systems and tooling
- 🗣️ The ability to explain them to someone who didn’t build them
- 📚 Creating clarity, trust, and usability — whether it’s for a hiring manager, a teammate, or a user in the wild

## But the challenge remains...

How do I list this (on a résumé or profile)?

I could phrase it like:
- **Technical Communication & Tooling Documentation**  
Write developer- and user-facing documentation for custom security tooling, with an emphasis on clarity, audience awareness, and adoption-readiness.

Or, more casually in a README bio or project blurb:

> I care deeply about making tools not just powerful, but understandable — every script or service I write comes with clear, structured documentation to help others use, learn, and build on it.

But then we're back to **where** do we put it, and **what** audience is looking at it.

## Ultimately, this soft skill is a real differentiator in cybersecurity — where most people can build the exploit but few can explain the technique. Let's do both.

Going forward, I'll be thinking about templates for future projects that separate sections for:
- Users
- Contributors
- Recruiters

## TL;DR
This document attempts a concise, articulate breakdown of a problem and a solution few developers even notice. It reflects design thinking, empathy, and technical fluency. Light kit, heavy skill — that's the way forward.
